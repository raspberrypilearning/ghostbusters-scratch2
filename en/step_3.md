## Random ghosts

Your ghost is really easy to catch at the moment, because it doesn't move!

--- task ---

Can you add code to your ghost so that, instead of staying in the same position, the ghost appears at random positions on the Stage?

--- hint ---

Each time before your ghost appears, it should `go to`{:class="blockmotion"} a random position on the Stage.

There are two sets of code blocks you could use here. Choose the set you prefer.

Or add this one to your sprite:
